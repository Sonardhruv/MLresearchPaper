## Predicting Patient Readmission Using Bi-LSTM and XGBoost

## Description: 

This repository contains the implementation of our research study focused on predicting patient readmission using deep learning (BiLSTM) and ensemble learning (XGBoost) models. The project encompasses data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and result visualization.

## Dataset Information:

The dataset used for this study was obtained from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dubradave/hospital-readmissions

This dataset contains de-identified medical information including patient diagnoses, discharge dates, comorbidities, and readmission indicators.

## Code Information:

The repository includes the following main components:

Plots.py: Python script likely used for generating visualizations.
dia_imb2.csv: CSV file containing dataset information.
diabetic_data.csv: CSV file containing the main diabetic dataset.
main.py: Main Python script to run the project or specific functionalities.
metrics.py: Python script containing functions for evaluating model performance.

## Usage Instructions

1. Clone the Repository
   
git clone https://github.com/Sonardhruv/MLresearchPaper.git
cd MLresearchPaper

2. Install Dependencies

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost tensorflow keras


3. Add Dataset Files
Download and place the following datasets in the root directory:

diabetic_data.csv

dia_imb2.csv

4. Run the Main Program

python main.py

5. Review the Outputs
6. Visualizations and Results:
Charts generated by 'Plots.py' and model evaluation metrics from 'metrics.py' will be available as defined within the scripts. Check the console output and any specified output directories within the scripts for results.
Model performance metrics will be printed to the console.

Plots and charts will be saved to the directory for analysis.

## Methodology

**Preprocessing:** Missing values imputed with mode, categorical features label encoded, class imbalance handled with SMOTE, numerical features standardized, and reshaped for BiLSTM.

**Modeling:** A hybrid approach using:
1.  **Bi-LSTM:** A sequential neural network with two bidirectional LSTM layers and dropout for learning temporal patterns.
2.  **XGBoost:** A gradient boosting classifier trained on BiLSTM's output for final prediction.

**Evaluation:** 10-fold stratified cross-validation was used. Metrics reported include: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUROC, Error Rate, Specificity, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC).

**Visualization:** Libraries like `matplotlib` and `seaborn` were used for potential data trend and model performance visualizations. Data trends and model performance were visualized using Figma and Mermaid as well.
